# AspectJProgramming
Aspect Oriented Programming provides special feature to separately edit and modify the existing behaviour of the code and play around the exsiting code without actually modifying it.

Description:
 1. This project helped me to understand the usage of pointcuts, advice functions, and cross tree constraints, data tracking for a set of values and playing with the result.
 2. So, I have incorporated the right behaviour in the AspectJ programming without modifying the code.

Knowledge Gained:
  1. I understood the purpose of AspectJ Programming and have done AspectJ code for the existing code by creating cross tree constraints. 
  2. I have the basic understand of how to use the pointcuts and where and when the pointcut applies. Also, how the advice functioanlity works with the pointcut.
  3. Also, I have learnt here how to get the aggregate functions on a certain Set or List of values and to track them.
